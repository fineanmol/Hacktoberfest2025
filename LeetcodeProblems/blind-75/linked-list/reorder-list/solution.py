# Reorder List - LeetCode #143

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        if not head or not head.next:

        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        
        # Reverse second half
        prev = None
        curr = slow
        while curr:
            next_node = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
