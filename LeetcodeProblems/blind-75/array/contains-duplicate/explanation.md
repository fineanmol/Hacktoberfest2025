# Contains Duplicate - Problem #217

## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

## Examples
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
```

## Approach
Use a set to track seen numbers. If a number is already in the set, return true.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)
